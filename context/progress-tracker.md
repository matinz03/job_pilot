## Decisions Made During Build

- Homepage CTAs link to `/login` until authentication is implemented in Feature 02.
- Homepage uses supplied public preview assets rather than recreating dashboard, jobs, or agent-log illustrations.
- Auth uses `@insforge/sdk` and its SSR helpers. Next.js 16 `proxy.ts` protects authenticated routes; `middleware.ts` is deprecated.
- A minimal authenticated dashboard destination exists until Feature 14 replaces it with the complete dashboard UI.
- PostHog initializes through Next.js `instrumentation-client.ts`; server captures must create and shut down a client per request. OAuth identifies the authenticated user after the server-side code exchange, and authenticated Navbar instances reset PostHog only after InsForge signs out. Domain events remain limited to the four event names in `code-standards.md` and will be added with their owning flows.
- Database schema lives in `migrations/20260824182323_feature-04-database-schema.sql` and has been applied through the InsForge CLI. `profiles`, `agent_runs`, `jobs`, and `agent_logs` have user-scoped RLS; `agent_runs.status`, `jobs.source`, and `jobs.match_score` have durable database checks. The private `resumes` bucket is path-scoped to `{user_id}/resume.pdf` through four `storage.objects` RLS policies. Tailored job-description fields remain intentionally out of scope.
